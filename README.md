## Moves 🏃🏾 - A React Native App

Moves keeps track of your movement across a path on a map.
You can save these movements and later view them on the map for reference.

## Let's get started

From your terminal:

```sh
npm start
```

Press "i" when the Metro Bundler runs to open the application on the ios simulator.

You can simulate movement on the map from the menu:

```sh
features ---> location ---> Select a movement method. Eg; Freeway Drive
```
